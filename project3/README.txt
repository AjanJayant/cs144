This example contains a simple utility class to simplify opening database
connections in Java applications, such as the one you will write to build
your Lucene index. 

To build and run the sample code, use the "run" ant target inside
the directory with build.xml by typing "ant run".i

I have chose to include inverted indexes for item name, category, and 
description as they are all required by 2) Advanced Search. I include MySQL
indexes buyPrice, bidder, seller and ending time.
